# Bootstrap Dashboard
Responsive layout built with Bootstrap 4.5.

## Features

Using this template you will be able to leverage lots of built-in components and thus focus on building features that set you apart from competitors rather than bulding everything from scratch. Lite version of a Sing-app includes following features and pages:
* Bootstrap 4+ & SCSS
* Responsive layout
* Styled Bootstrap components like buttons, modals, etc
* Dashboard sample
* Typography
* Tables
* Notifications
* Base charts
* Icons
* Maps
* Hover sidebar

All other features like themining, login, additional pages, etc are available in a [full version](https://flatlogic.com/templates/sing-app-vue).

Building a project from scratch means that there is a lot of things to keep track of all at once: analytics, dynamic forms data, UI and UX elements, and much more. This simple admin template is well suited for web apps or any other website or project that requires admin dashboard. This template will serve as a solid foundation for your upcoming project and will save you a lot of time and, hence, money.
