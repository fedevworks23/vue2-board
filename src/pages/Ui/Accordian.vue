                I had an idea named Great Work. It was a service aimed to help
                people find their passion. Yes I know it sound crazy and super
                naïve but I worked on that. I started to work on planning,
                graphics, presentations, pictures, descriptions, articles,
                investments and so on. I worked on everything but not the
                project itself.

                  There are few reasons we want to tell you, why we have created
                  it: We didn't like the darkness of most of admin templates, so
                  we created this light one. We didn't like the high contrast of
                  most of admin templates, so we created this unobtrusive one.
                  We searched for a solution of how to make widgets look like
                  real widgets, so we decided that deep background - is what
                  makes widgets look real.
